# Keyboard Project

This project is a visual keyboard inspired by the one on [Monkeytype](monkeytype.com). It was developed in a few hours as a fun way to get creative and practice coding, while implementing
runes and whatever else Svelte 5 has to offer. The goal was to replicate the look and feel of the monkeytype keyboard while adding some personal touches. I have made it responsive, but 
it is best enjoyed on a large screen.
